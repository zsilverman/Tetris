# Tetris

Fills a rectangular array of cells that can be occupied by shapes by using randomly selected shapes at random positions until the domain is full. Creates a graphical representation of the domain as a scalable vector graphics (svg) file. The svg file can be visualized using a browser such as Firefox, Safari, Chrome or Internet Explorer.
